          ### Getting started with remoteStorage.js

          Although you may choose to integrate remoteStorage sync in your
          server-side program, or using a custom client-side library, we
          usually recommend and assume you use
          [remoteStorage.js](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js)
          in a client-side web application. Here's a quick overview of how that
          works:

          <h4 id="widget">1. The Widget</h4>

          <img class="widget" src="/img/widget.png" alt="widget">

          The remoteStorage widget allows your users to connect to their
          personal storage server. By default it is part of every app that uses
          remoteStorage.js. So every time a user sees the widget, they know
          that they can use their own storage with an app. You can customize
          the widget's appearance to better match your app's design, of course.

          <h4 id="modules">2. Categories, Modules &amp; Schemas</h4>

          (See also our <a href="https://remotestorage.github.io/modules/">modules documentation</a>)

          remoteStorage data is stored in directories – also known as
          "categories" – for which your app requests access (either read-only or
          full). The user grants these permissions via OAuth during the first
          connect from your app.

          For common data, remoteStorage.js uses per-category modules, which
          provide a method of reading and writing a certain defined type of
          data, e.g. documents, contacts, or images. You can choose from a
          variety of common and custom modules that already exist, or build
          your own.

          <h4 id="examples">Example Apps</h4>

          Check out the demo app ["My Favorite Drinks"](https://drinks-unhosted.5apps.com/)
          ([source code](https://github.com/remotestorage/myfavoritedrinks)).
          There's also a starter kit with a
          [hello-world example](https://github.com/remotestorage/starter-kit/blob/master/apps/hello-world),
          so you can read the source code without the distraction of tasty drinks.

          <h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>

          We're still working on better guides and documentation (and you're
          invited to [contribute](/community/)). However, the library's API
          documentation is up-to-date, and also includes some guides:
