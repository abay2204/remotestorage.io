        :markdown
          Using a hosted accounts means entrusting someone else with your data,
          in exchange for not having to set up or maintain a storage server
          yourself.

          As remoteStorage is an open protocol, you can use migration programs
          to move all of your data to any other remoteStorage-capable provider,
          server or local machine at any time.
