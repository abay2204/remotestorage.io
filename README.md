remotestorage.io
================

Umbrella website for all things remoteStorage.

### DEPRECATION WARNING

This is still running the code on remotestorage.io, but a new
[website](https://github.com/remotestorage/website) and
[wiki](https://wiki.remotestorage.io) are in the works and you're encouraged to
contribute to those instead.

### Setup / Installation

This website is using [roots](http://roots.cx/), a toolbox for static web sites
and apps. Getting started is easy as pie:

    npm install -g roots@2.1.4

Then clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `roots watch` for
auto-compilation and live-reload of your browser window.
